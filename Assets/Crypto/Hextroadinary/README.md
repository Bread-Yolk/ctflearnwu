## DESCRIPTION:

Meet ROXy, a coder obsessed with being exclusively the worlds best hacker. 
She specializes in short cryptic hard to decipher secret codes. 
The below hex values for example, she did something with them to generate a secret code, can you figure out what? Your answer should start with 0x.

0xc4115 0x4cf8

## HINT:
- NONE

## STEPS:
1. Based from the description, we need to submit the flag with `0x` as the prefix.
2. Also something caught my attention, the `ROX` word.
3. It could be related to XOR, what comes to my mind is [XOR calculator](https://xor.pw/#)
4. Paste both hexadecimal value there.

> RESULT

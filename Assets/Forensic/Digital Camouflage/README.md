## DESCRIPTION:

We need to gain access to some routers. 
Let's try and see if we can find the password in the captured network data: https://mega.nz/#!XDBDRAQD!4jRcJvAhMkaVaZCOT3z3zkyHre2KHfmkbCN5lYpiEoY 
Hint 1: It looks like someone logged in with their password earlier. Where would log in data be located in a network capture?
<br /> 
Hint 2: If you think you found the flag, but it doesn't work, consider that the data may be encrypted.

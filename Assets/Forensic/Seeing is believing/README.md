## DESCRIPTION:
My colleague's an astronaut who's currently on a mission orbiting in space. Just a few hours ago, unfortunately, his communication device caught fire so he's unable to report back to base. 
\I did, however, receive a strange file that I can't seem to open. I think it may shed some light on his situation. Can you help me save poor boy Johnny?
